                   People abuse substances such as drugs, alcohol, and  <a href="url this link goes to">tabacco</a>  for varied and complicated reasons, but it is clear that our society pays a significant cost. The toll for this abuse can be seen in our hospitals and emergency departments through direct damage to health by  <a href="url this link goes to">substance abuse</a> and its link to physical trauma. Jails and prisons tally daily the strong connection between crime and drug dependence and abuse. Although use of some drugs such as  <a href="url this link goes to">cocaine</a> has declined, use of other drugs such as  <a href="url this link goes to">heroin</a> and "club drugs" has increased.
